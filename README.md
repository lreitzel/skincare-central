Welcome to Skincare Central! 
This application was created for users to check out skincare products they're thinking about trying, and to leave reviews on products they've used! Let's be honest, it's hard to trust reviews on websites that also sell the products, so this is meant to serve as an objective third party.

To begin:
- Clone this repository from Github and open it on your local machine
- Before you can begin, you need to add a '.env' file and add the '.env' file to '.gitignore' IMMEDIATELY
- You need to set up your own new project through the Google Developer Console so that you can get your own Google Client Id and Google Secret Id. Once you have these, save them in your '.env' file.
- Now you can start up the rails server using the command 'rails s' and go to localhost:3000 in your browser to begin using Skincare Central! 
- From there you can create an account to start adding products and reviews of your own, or you can just browse through the reviews and products before deciding to make your own profile.

Thank you and I hope you enjoy!
